# Glitch - another store?

Yes. 

## Motivation: The Why

tl;dr: 
- I liked the general readability of `zustand` (https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - but it was still too big for my needs
- I wanted a dependency-free store (less maintenance, yay!)
- I wanted a store solving the Problem of ever-recurring side-effects: I call it **Lock-or-Leave**
