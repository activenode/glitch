# _Unglitch_ - another store?

**This library has 985 bytes itself (compressed with `brotli` which every browser supports).
Adding up its single dependency `fast-equals` it comes down to less than 2.8kb**

React 18+ only and not planning to port to anything else. Get your sh\*t up-to-date. No Context Provider needed, hooks only.

**But will there be Support for Vanilla, Vue, Stencil, etc?**
Maybe. Not the highest prio on my roadmap but shouldn't be a big deal to provide it. Feel free to contribute.
