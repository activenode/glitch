Yes. React 18+ only and not planning to port to anything else. Get your sh\*t up-to-date. No Context Provider needed, hooks only.

**But will there be Support for Vanilla, Vue, Stencil, etc?**
Maybe. Not the highest prio on my roadmap but shouldn't be a big deal to provide it. Feel free to contribute.

## How to use it

Coming soon, planning on providing CodeSandboxes. Since most of it is equal to the old version check out https://github.com/activenode/unglitch/blob/7f1e85e10d4cc730d1d65f139d7ed06cf4feef08/README.md
